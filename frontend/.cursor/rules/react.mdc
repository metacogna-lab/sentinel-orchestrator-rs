# React

- Use functional components only - no class components
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) for state and side effects
- Use TypeScript for all components - .tsx extension, typed props
- Keep components pure when possible - minimize side effects
- Use React.memo for expensive components - memoize when props are stable
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled - manage form state explicitly
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect - exhaustive deps
- Handle loading and error states explicitly - never assume data exists
- Use error boundaries for error handling - catch component errors gracefully
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic - follow hooks naming convention (use*)
