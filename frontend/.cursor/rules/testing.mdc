# Testing

- Write tests for components using React Testing Library - test behavior, not implementation
- Write tests for API client functions - mock fetch/axios responses
- Use Vitest for unit testing - fast, Vite-native test runner
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking - intercept network requests
- Test error paths, not just happy paths - verify error handling works
- Use TypeScript in tests - maintain type safety in test code
- Keep tests simple and focused - one assertion per test when possible
- Use descriptive test names - describe what is being tested
- Test user interactions - clicks, form submissions, keyboard events
- Test edge cases and error conditions - empty states, network failures
