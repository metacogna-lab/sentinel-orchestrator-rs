# Architecture

- Follow strict separation between frontend and backend - frontend should not know backend implementation details
- Use TypeScript interfaces that match src/core/types.rs contracts exactly - immutable API contracts
- Keep API client layer separate from UI components - use service/API layer pattern
- Use React hooks for state management - prefer useState, useEffect, useReducer over external state libraries
- Follow component composition patterns - prefer composition over prop drilling
- Keep components small and focused - single responsibility principle
- Use strict TypeScript mode - no implicit any, strict null checks
- Type all API responses/requests using generated types from OpenAPI schema
