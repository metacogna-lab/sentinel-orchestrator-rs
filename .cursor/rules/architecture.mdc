# Architecture

- Enforce Hexagonal Architecture: core has no external I/O deps - pure domain logic only
- Traits in `core/traits.rs` define interfaces - adapters implement these traits
- Adapters in `adapters/` implement traits - keep infrastructure separate from domain
- Use `async-trait` for async trait methods - required for async trait bounds
- Keep domain logic pure (no tokio, reqwest, etc. in core) - testable without mocks
