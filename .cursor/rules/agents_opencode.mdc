# OpenCode Agent Prompts

This project references agent prompts stored in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

## Available Agents

The following agents are defined in the OpenCode configuration:

- **rs_agent** (Canonical Rust Specialist) - Principal Rust Engineer and Compiler Architect
- **rs_dreamer** (The Memory Specialist) - Focuses on Data Structures, Vector Embeddings, and Storage Efficiency
- **rs_sentinel** (The Implementer) - Senior Rust Architect focused on high-performance, crash-free execution
- **rs_supervisor** (The Implementer) - Senior Rust Architect focused on high-performance, crash-free execution

## Usage

These agent prompts are stored in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and can be referenced for role-specific development guidelines. Each prompt defines specific coding standards, philosophies, and interaction rules for that agent role.

The original markdown files are located in `~/.config/opencode/prompts/`:
- `rs_agent.md`
- `rs_dreamer.md`
- `rs_sentinel.md`
- `rs_supervisor.md`
