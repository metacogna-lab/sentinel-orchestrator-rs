# Task Instructions

Always start a new feature branch for new work, write tests to start, develop a phase of @tasks/prd.md - test, commit, merge, push main. Then start again. Run "/check" if in rust and use the rs_agent in claude code. Follow the PRD and only edit do not delete. If you find errors record them in tasks/errors.md

Always follow @docs/architecture.md to ensure architecture is rigorous and defined. All code must adhere to the architectural principles documented there.
